These are notes detailing how implementations in React differ from Vue, for common things like

* Parent to child relationships
* Passing Props
* Conditionally stylizing classes
* Higher order components
* Folder hierarchy
* Routing
* Initialization (CLI tools)
* Global state management (the most popular ones)
* Routing
* Wrapping content
* Lifecycle methods
* Slotting (Vue)
* Directives (Vue)
* AJAX requests

As well as examples detailing implementation in folders within this repo. 

## Wrapper content conditionally

React uses `React.fragment` to handle multiple sibling divs in one component

Vue uses `<templates>` to handle same thing
